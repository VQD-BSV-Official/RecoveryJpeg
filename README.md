Recover your precious photos. There are 3 ways to repair: Extract thumbnails, replace header (FF DA), Concatenate MCUs in file structure. I learned how to repair corrupted images in more depth, I learned from the sources: [JpegRepair](https://github.com/dmahurin/jpegrepair), [JpegRecovery](https://github.com/euzun/jpeg-carver-csharp)

If you can not fix, please send me a broken file and good sample file (if any), please upload to drive, mega ..etc. <br>
and send the link to my gmail. And if successful, this is not free.


## Usage
- File -> Using Header -> None (Use when the image has incorrect pixels) [Video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OUbORvWM_k)

> [!Tip]
> * File -> Using Header -> x25805 (Used in case of ransomware)
> * File -> Using Header -> File RAW (CR2, NEF, ARW)
> * Image -> Export Folder (Extract all found jpeg)
> * Image -> Edit Image (Y, Cr, Cb - ins or del block)
> * Image -> Create New (Automatic size)


> [!Note]

> The same parameters (Image resolution, device).
