*Recover your precious photos. There are 3 ways to repair: Extract thumbnails, replace header (FF DA), Concatenate MCUs in file structure. I learned how to repair corrupted images in more depth, I learned from the sources: [JpegRepair](https://github.com/dmahurin/jpegrepair), [JpegRecovery](https://github.com/euzun/jpeg-carver-csharp), [JPEG-Repair Toolkit](https://www.disktuna.com/jpgrepair-fix-and-repair-corrupt-jpeg-headers-and-invalid-markers/)*

```You can contact me via gmail (email) to save the files you need. This will cost you a fee, thank you. If you have any problems or questions here => https://github.com/VQD-BSV-Official/RecoveryJpeg/issues, I will reply as soon as possible.```
